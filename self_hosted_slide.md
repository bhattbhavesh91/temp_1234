### Slide Title: **Fine-Tuning Small LLMs for Banking Context**

---

#### **Process of Fine-Tuning Small LLMs**
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Collect domain-specific banking data (e.g., transactions, compliance policies, customer queries).  
   - Clean and preprocess data to ensure high quality.  

2. **Model Selection**:  
   - Choose an appropriate small LLM (e.g., Llama-2, GPT-J, Falcon) to fit computational constraints.

3. **Fine-Tuning**:  
   - Use banking-specific datasets to train the model with supervised fine-tuning techniques.  
   - Incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for improved relevance.  

4. **Evaluation and Validation**:  
   - Test the model using domain-specific benchmarks and use cases (e.g., fraud detection, loan eligibility).  
   - Iterate based on results for further refinement.

5. **Deployment**:  
   - Host the fine-tuned LLM on secure, self-hosted infrastructure for better control over data and compliance.  
   - Continuously monitor for performance improvements and domain updates.

#### **Benefits of Fine-Tuning for Banking Context**
1. **Enhanced Domain Relevance**:  
   - Tailored understanding of banking-specific terminology, customer interactions, and compliance requirements.  

2. **Cost Efficiency**:  
   - Small LLMs reduce infrastructure and operational costs compared to large models.  

3. **Data Privacy**:  
   - Self-hosted solutions ensure sensitive customer data stays within the organization, complying with regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.  

4. **Improved Performance**:  
   - Models fine-tuned for niche banking tasks outperform general-purpose models in accuracy and reliability.  

5. **Customizability**:  
   - Flexibility to adapt to changing regulatory or operational needs within the banking sector.

6. **Competitive Edge**:  
   - Faster and more accurate responses in customer service, fraud detection, and decision-making processes.
