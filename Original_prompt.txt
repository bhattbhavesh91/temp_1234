	- Rest all the cards are unique to either credit card or debit card, so even though credit or debit is not mentioned explicitly, identify the intent based on type of card.
	- Club Vistara(CV) is a credit card.

- Follow below instructions ONLY if debit card is NOT mentioned in the query:
	1) CFAR related queries without mention of debit card are relevant to credit cards. So, in this case add "yes" to credit card intent and "no" to debit card intent.
	2) Offers on brands/merchants without mention of debit card are relevant to credit cards. So, in this case add "yes" to credit card intent and "no" to debit card intent.
